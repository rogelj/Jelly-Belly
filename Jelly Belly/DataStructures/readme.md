## Data Structures 

The focus of this week’s assignment is to create & display data from a collection. Using types, optionals, collections & iterations. One could use a Tuple, Array, Set, or Dictionary to group data. 

You can also choose to use While Loops or For Loops Iterate over your collection of data. 

For an app like Jelly Belly,  some ideas include:

- Collection of the meal’s on the menu
- Collection of orders placed by the customers
- Collection of drinks on the menu

## Tasks

- [ ]  **Assignment 1:** Create an Xcode playground.
  - Create a struct or class to model data for your app. Examples of app data:
  - - For the shopping, it could be the items you are selling.
    - For the Trip Planner, it could be a hotel booked for the trip.
    - For the Pet diary, it could be a Grooming spa used for the pet.
    - For the restaurant, it could be a meal on the menu.
- [ ]  **Assignment 2:** 
  - Create an empty collection to hold a group of the data you collected in Assignment 1.
  - Select either a Tuple, Array, Set, or Dictionary as the type for your collection.
  - Use your knowledge of the different collection types to select an appropriate collection.
- [ ]  **Assignment 3:**
  - Make one of the properties of the struct or class you created in Assignment 1 optional. 
- [ ]  **Assignment 4:** 
  - Create Six instances/objects using the struct or class you created in Assignment 1.
  - For 2 of the objects created above provide the value as nil for the property you marked as optionals in Assignment 3.
- [ ]  **Assignment 5:**
  - Create a function that takes an object as a parameter & adds the objects you created in Assignment 3 & 4 to the collection in created Assignment 2.
  - Use the function created above to add objects to the collection.  
- [ ]  **Assignment 6:**
  - Create a function that takes a collection as a parameter & prints out all elements of the collection whose optional properties are not nil. 
  - Use the function created above to print out data from your collection. 
- [ ]  **Assignment 7:**
  - Transfer the code from the playground to an appropriately named model file in your app code base.
  - Successfully build the app. 

**Nice to have:**

- [ ]  Display the data on the iPhone simulator.
- [ ] Create more than one collection.
- [ ] Use a return statement
