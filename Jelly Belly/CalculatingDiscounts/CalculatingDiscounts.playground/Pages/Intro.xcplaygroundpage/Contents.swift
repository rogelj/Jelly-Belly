//: # Week 3 - Calculating Discounts
//:
//: Students will work on calculating discounts this week. There can be different ways of doing the same thing. For example: one could use a function/ computed property/ closure/ method to calculate discount. The idea of this week’s assignment is to grasp all these concepts well as they form the core logic of an app. Students can use a playground to play around with these concepts. As a final step, the code that best fits in the app goes there. The focus of this week’s assignment is to create & display data from a collection. Using types, optionals, collections & iterations. One could use a Tuple, Array, Set, or Dictionary to group data.
//:
//: Important definitions:
//: Properties/ Data/ Formulae student needs:
//:
//: - `itemPrices`: An array containing prices of 7 (or any number of) items.
//: - `totalAmount`: Total amount of all items before applying discount. (A single value.)
//: - `discountPercentage`: A percentage discount number. For example: 5%, 10%.
//: - `discountType`: Type of discount to be applied on an item. Discount types could be Default discount (5%), Thanksgiving discount (10%), Christmas discount (15%), New year discount (20%).
//: - `discountedAmount`: Amount after applying `discount` on `totalAmount`. Formula: `totalAmount * 0.5` (if a discount of 5% is applied).
//: - `totalAmountAfterDiscount`: `total Amount - discountedAmount`
